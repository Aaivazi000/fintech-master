# Week #2 Research Report

This document is a report on the S&amp;P 500 its characteristics and trends that make it unique. Some of the topics covered will include Annual &amp; Seasonal trends in S&amp;P 500 and Macroeconomic factors that contribute to S&amp;P 500 performance.

**Foundational Information:**

1. What is it?
  1. **A.** S&amp;P 500 stands for the _Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 Index_.
  2. **B.**** DEF:** The S&amp;P 500 is an index of 505 stocks issued by 500 largest companies with market capitalizations (a company&#39;s stock price \* # of public stocks of that company held by shareholders, pretty much the total value of a company) of at least $6.1 billion. Public stocks are those not held by employees or governments.
    1. What is an index?
      1. a)An index is a sample of companies collected into a group, like a sample of a population. The population being all the companies on the stock market
      2. b)Indexes are used to track the performance of all the companies within the index. So if the S&amp;P 500 index goes up by 1% that means the stocks that make up that index have increased by an AVERAGE of 1%. **Look at the index with a percent changes.**
  3. **C.** The S&amp;P is seen as the leading indicator of how well U.S equities (the value of the shares issued by a company) are doing AND how well the large-cap universe (companies with market capitalizations \&gt; $10 billion) is doing.
2. If the S&amp;P 500 is mostly large-cap companies how is it a reflector of the market??
  1. **A.** S&amp;P is seen as the most accurate gauge of large cap US companies. It is considered a good reflector of the WHOLE market because contains companies spanning across a large range of industries.
  2. **B.** The index is frequently updated - on a quarterly basis.
  3. **C.** The index holds more companies. 500 compared to Dow&#39;s 30

# Trends &amp; Historical Patterns in the S&amp;P 500 (post 2008)

This sections reviews numerous published papers in and around the topic of understanding trends in the S&amp;P 500&#39;s returns and stock prices. For each source there is a brief summary and all sources are in the Google Drive or in the _Web Sources_ document.

1. [Cost of Equity &amp; S&amp;P 500 Index Revisions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qQxrdME_x11Yn6JCnk8i0-IAwuG7rgZ) (2012)
  1. Summary:
    1. The paper looks at the effects on companies when they are removed or added to the index. To study the effects they measure the change in cost of equity, liquitity, and shadow cost.
      1. a)_Cost of Equity_ - in general it is the return one requires to decide if an investment meets capital return requirements. It represents the compensation the market demands in exchange for owing the asset and bearing the burden of ownership. Capital return is part of your original investment that you receive back and is not taxed.
      2. b)_Liquidity_ - the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold without affecting the asset&#39;s price.
      3. c)_Shadow Cost -_ Monetary value assigned to costs that are unknown or difficult to calculate.
  2. Results:
    1. Data supports the liquidity (a-c) and investor awareness hypotheses (d-e)
      1. a)Study proved that the cost of equity decreases when a firm is added and increases when a firm is removed. Found that liquidity increases for added stocks and decreases for deleted stocks. Also shadow cost increases for added stocks and remains constant for deleted stocks.
      2. b)The change is cost of equity is explained by the increase in liquidity, decrease in shadow cost, and large firm size.
      3. c)For deleted firms, leverage is the only significant determinant of the change is cost of equity. Neither changes in liquidity or shadow cost impact cost of equity.
      4. d)When firms are added (aka inclusion events) the firm&#39;s whose cost of equity decreases have larger excess returns. And firms with a larger investment opportunity set may be more prepared to take advantage of the reduction in cost of equity experience by the newly added firms.

1. [Price Effects of Addition or Deletion from the S&amp;P 500 Index](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qQxrdME_x11Yn6JCnk8i0-IAwuG7rgZ) (2002)
  1. Note
    1. Prior to 1989 the S&amp;P 500 would announce they would add or delete a stock from the index and do the addition/deletion after trading closed on a single day. Starting in 1989 they allow at least 1 week between the announcement and change date.
  2. Summary
    1. The study examined the price and volume history of firms added to the S&amp;P 500 between 1990-2000. Since firms are added within a week, resulting in high demand for the added stock on the add-day, the study wanted to test the efficient market hypotheis (EMH)
      1. a)_EMH_ - States share prices reflect all the information available and generating consistent alpha is impossible. Therefore no amount of analysis (tech or fund.) can produce excess returns, only inside information can result in outsized returns. It states that stocks always trade at their fair value so it is impossible for investors to buy undervalued stocks or stocks with inflated prices. AS SUCH it is impossible to outperform the market with great market timing or expert stock selection, the only way to make these returns is to make riskier investments.
  3. Results
    1. For additions
      1. a)Found a positive average return of 4.34% from AD close to Next Day close.
      2. b)Found an additional 5.45% from Next Day close (after AD) to CD close. Using a strategy of selling short $1 of the index and going long $1 of the stock for additions this 5.45% increase can be used to make profits that far outweighed trading costs.
      3. c)Price release over the 7 day period from AD to CD results in a 3.12 % increase. This 3.12% was deemed insignificant by researchers.
    2. For Deletions
      1. a)Reactions were similar but in the opposite direction
      2. b)Found a 6.51% decrease from AD close to CD close.
      3. c)Found a 3.26% decrease from AD close to Next Day open.
      4. d)Found a 10.15% decrease from open after AD to close of the same day. One can make positive returns from this event by shorting $1 on the open and covering at the close. This means they would buy $1 of the index and open and short $1 of the stock at close.
      5. e)Found no price release and instead found a permanent price decrease of 10.13% which is related to lower overall demand for removed stock.

1. [Day of Week Effects in pre-holiday returns of the S&amp;P 500](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qQxrdME_x11Yn6JCnk8i0-IAwuG7rgZ) (2005)
  1. Summary
    1. The study looked at the period of 1930-1999 S&amp;P 500 returns, specifically at day of week effects on pre-holiday returns.
  2. Results
    1. Results are consistent with previous studies which prove that before 1987 there were strong pre-holiday effects but after 1987 the effect diminished.
    2. There is no weekend effect on pre-holiday returns.
    3. There is a Labor day effect in pre-1987 returns (the return on the day before labor day is significantly better than before other Monday holidays). However this effect is not observed after 1987.
  3. Notes
    1. Pre-1987, the pre-holiday effect was the fact that the returns on a day prior to a holiday in the S&amp;P 500 were considerably higher than the avg. rate of return on a normal trading day.
    2. In Oct 19th, 1987 (Black Monday) it was the single largest one-day drop in stocks in history (DOW fell 22%). Pretty much everyone started selling their stocks and the sales led to more sales, which led to a market crash. The crash wasn&#39;t bad per se b/c markets bounced back within a year or so and exceeded their value.

1. [Evidence of Long Memory in US Stock Returns: Case of 1990s Bubble](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qQxrdME_x11Yn6JCnk8i0-IAwuG7rgZ)
  1. Summary
    1. _Long Memory_ - Long range dependence (LRD, or long-memory) is a phenomenon in time-series data. In time series data there should be a rate of decay in statistical dependence of two points as the distance (aka time) between those 2 points grows. Long memory is a phenomenon where the dependence between 2 points has a rate of decay that is slower than exponential decay.
    2. The study looked at different stock market returns (NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, and DOW) in two time periods, pre-1992 and during the bubble from 1992-2002. The 1992-2002 bubble is known for market exuberance.
  2. Results
    1. The study found that as expected there was no evidence of long memory in equity stocks in the pre-1992 time period.
    2. Using Lo&#39;s modified R/S analysis on NASDAQ, DIJIA, and S&amp;P 500 they found strong evidence of persistence in the bubble period or NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500.
    3. They conclude that long-memory in stock data would affect the accuracy of inferences and forecasts based on traditional linear models with independence assumptions.

1. [Volatility Dynamics for the S&amp;P 500: Evidence from Realized Volatility, Daily Volatility, Daily Returns, and Option Prices](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qQxrdME_x11Yn6JCnk8i0-IAwuG7rgZ)
  1. Summary
    1. The study argues that most recent option valuation studies use an affine square root (SQR) stochastic volatility model and that this is a good choice because this model has closed-form solutions for option prices. The study investigates alternatives to the SQR model by comparing it&#39;s performance with 5 other models. They use 3 sources of data being realized volatilities, S&amp;P 500 returns, and option data.
  2. Results
    1. They conclude that testing on all 3 sources proves the best volatility specification is one with LINEAR rather than square root diffusion for variance. They state this model handle the stylized facts in realized volatilities, performs well on fitting different samples of index returns, and has the lowest option-implied volatility mean-squared-error in and out of sample.
  3. Notes
    1. This study is less about the S&amp;P 500 and more about modeling volatility. The conclusions of the study are not incredibly useful to us at the moment BUT it may prove useful in the future when assessing the volatility measures of trading strategies.

# Macroeconomic factors that affect the S&amp;P 500 (post 2008)

This sections reviews numerous published papers in and around the topic of understanding how macroeconomic factors affect the S&amp;P 500&#39;s returns and stock prices. For each source there is a brief summary and all sources are in the Google Drive or in the _Web Sources_ document.

1. [On the Volatility and Comovement of US Financial Markets around Macroeconomic News Announcements](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18qQxrdME_x11Yn6JCnk8i0-IAwuG7rgZ)
  1. SUmmary
    1. The purpose of the study is to provide more insight into how US stocks,  treasury, and corporate bond markets respond in the short term to surprise US macro information. Beside the returns they examine the volatility and co-movement of those assets&#39; returns. The macro factors they look at are consumer price index (CPI), unemployment rate, nonfarm payroll employment, and the target federal funds rate. They address 4 questions
      1. **a)**_What is the impact of these macroeconomic announcements on asset returns and asset return volatility in the proximity of their first release?_
      2. **b)**_Does the release of macroeconomic news surprises affect the markets for different asset classes (stocks, gov&#39;t bonds, corporate bonds) in different ways?_
      3. **c)**_Do macro announcements affect the existing degree of covariance between the different asset classes?_
      4. **d)**_Is the impact of these macro announcements instantaneous or protracted over time?_
    2. They looked at NYSE-AMEX and NASDAQ, 5-10-30 year Treasury bonds and Aaa and Baa rated long term corporate bonds.
  2. Results
    1. Stock
      1. **a)**Conditional stock return volatility decreases on the trading day before, increases on the day of announcement, and then decreases on the day after.
    2. Bond
      1. **a)**Conditional bond return volatility increases on the day before announcement and decline after it is released. The effect is stronger on shorter term bonds.
    3. Generally
      1. **a)**The effects are asymmetric. Their magnitude is greater when the macro informations is &quot;bad&quot; news.
      2. **b)**Study shows complex info on the interaction between asset returns close to the macro announcement. HOWEVER they show little to no evidence in support of the notion that the arrival of macro news is accompanied by greater comovement among asset returns.
      3. **c)**Return comovement within and across stock and bond markets MOST OFTEN decreases in correspondence with announcements, especially then the announcement is &quot;bad news&quot;.

1. [US Stock Market &amp; Macroeconomic Factors](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oNHtbMi3LoU7k60P9CTbdzoxSn9LDpyW) (2016)
  1. Summary
    1. The study analyzes for relationships between the US stock market and the following macro factors: gross domestic product (value of all goods and services produced in the US), consumer price index (used as an index and to calculate inflation rate), industrial production index (cyclical indicator that measures the activity of industrial sector, not construction), unemployment rate, and long-term interest rates. All factors show relationships between with the market. **The study looks at the DOW in time period from Jan 2008 to April 2014, rather than the S&amp;P 500 but the insights are helpful.**
  2. Results
    1. DJ and GDP
      1. **a)**The study looked at the relationship between the DOW and real GDP, GDP growth rate, and growth rate adjusted for seasonality. They found there is a positive relationship between the real GDP and DOW (p = .95). Because of a time-lag in the graphs they state that the DOW can be a leading indicator of the US economy and the DOW is ahead of the GDP by about 6-months.
    2. DOW &amp; Industrial Production Index (IPI)
      1. **a)**There is a positive relationship between the DOW and IPI, and more reliable conclusions occur when seasonality is removed (p = .86, for real IPI)
    3. DOW &amp; Consumer Production Index (CPI)
      1. **a)**There is a positive relationship between the DOW &amp; CPI (as an index and inflation rate). Both as an index and an inflation rate there were similar patterns and close values (p = .91).
      2. **b)****Look at the graph for DOW and real CPI**
    4. DOW &amp; Interest Rates
      1. **a)**P = -.5
      2. **b)****Look at the graph for DOW and interest rates.**
    5. DOW &amp; Unemployment Rate
      1. **a)**P = -.46
      2. **b)****Look at the graph for DOW and unemployment rates.**

1. Stock Prices and Oil Prices
  1. Source 1: [Common Cycles and Common Trends in the stock and oil markets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oNHtbMi3LoU7k60P9CTbdzoxSn9LDpyW) (2015)
    1. The study looks at 150 years of data between West Texas Intermediate oil price and the S&amp;P 500 (1859 - 2015). The study was to analyze long and short run comovement properties of the two and to see the impacts of transitory and permanent shocks on the two.
  2. Source 2: [The Impact of Oil Price Shocks on the US Stock Market](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oNHtbMi3LoU7k60P9CTbdzoxSn9LDpyW) (2009)
    1. The study looked at how the US stock market responds to oil price shocks when the shocks come from demand and supply shocks in the oil market. The study found that, on average, in the long-run 22% of the variation in aggregate stock returns from 1975-2006 are attributed to the shocks that drive the crude oil market, making oil market fundamentals an important determinant of US stock returns.
    2. More than ⅔ of the contribution is driven by demand shocks for crude oil.
    3. There are industry specific reactions to the oil shocks that are much greater than those seen on the market. The reactions are larger for demand shocks than supply shocks.
      1. **a)**Gold and silver mining industry appreciate significantly in response to positive oil-market specific demand shocks
        1. (1)Petroleum and Natural Gas  are unaffected
        2. (2)Automobile and Retail sector stocks depreciate significantly and persistently.
      2. **b)**If the same changes are driven by innovations to global real economic activity, the share prices of all 4 sectors increase by different degrees.
