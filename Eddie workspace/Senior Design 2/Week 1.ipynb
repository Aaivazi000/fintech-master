    "FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS RESEARCH\n",
    "\n",
    "As we already know, fundamental analysis looks at the health and performance of the companies or industries by analyzing key values(fundamentals), rather than the technical data. It also uses quantitative analysis to make decisions. Before I talk more about quantitative analysis, I would like to talk about the 2 factors in fundamental analysis, long and short.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Long</b> - buy securities and usually haves no plan to sell till far future (Usually a company who's health and performance is very good). This is basically the most common strategy most investors use (though a lot do not know how to perform such evaluation). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Short</b> - sell securities and buys back at a lower price (Usually companies with mild or bad health and performance). By doing this, one can earn back some money while retaining the same amount of securities originally started with. Hedgefunds often use this strategy to make money. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall performance and health can be affected by macro and micro environment.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Macro (external) environment </b> refers to all forces outside of the company, that will affect the micro environment of the company. External is composed of 6 factors, which are demography, economy, physical, socio-cultural, politico-legal, and technological.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Micro (internal) environment </b> refers to all internal forces which are the consumers, competitors, suppliers, dealers, and distributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Quantitative analysis </b> trys to understand behavior by using mathematical and statistical modeling, measurement, and research. It also looks at key values to determine when to sell or buy securities. It utilizies it's statistical, <br>\n",
    "Key values:\n",
    "- P/E (Price per earning, Stock price / EPS) determines the ratio of how much you pay per earnings.\n",
    "- EPS (Earnings per Share, Net Income / # Common Shared Stocks) measures the companies profit per outstanding stock\n",
    "- Working Captial (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) determines how quickly they can pay off debts\n",
    "- Quick Ratio (Current Assets - Invetories / Current Liabilities) determines how much cash they can get to pay off debts (excluding inventories because it takes a while to be liquidated)\n",
    "- Debt-Equity Ratio (Total Debt / Shareholder's Equity) determines how much the company owes for every dollar. This is very important to understand because there are 3 different perspectives to this. 1) High D/E means the company owes a lot (but this can potentially bring the company much more profit from buying equipments, workers, etc...) 2) Low D/E means the company owes little which is stable but can mean they're not taking advantage to leverage higher profits. 3) Negative D/E, though this is rare, this means that the company does not have any debt and is usually a stock you would want to invest in, if you can find it.\n",
    "- Return on Equity (Net Income / Shareholder's Equity) determines how much profit a company makes with shareholder's money. The higher the better.\n",
    "- More to be updated...\n",
