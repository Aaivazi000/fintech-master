Project detail: 
Based on the S&P 500 Data, the goal of our project is to use General Adversarial Networks (GAN) to create permutations of the market which exhibit the traits of the real-world markets. Then we will create portfolios consisting of bots that will run various known strategies across the simulations to, ultimately, compare and contrast the performance of various market strategies.
