## Week # 1 SMART Goals ##
1. Write up a Literature Review onf S&P 500 Trends and key characteristics. The purpose of this research is to develop an understanding of key trends and qualities that are inherent to the S&P 500. This research will be used as the project continues to build the adversarial network in the GAN. Basically all the characteristics of the S&P 500 discovered must be maintained in our market simulations. The literature will utilize online resources including pulished papers and online articles (i.e investopedia). Published papers will be found using the CCNY databases and ACM libraries. There will be at the very least 5 reputable sources (online or printed) covering the topics below and any additional topics that are relevant:
    - Annual & Seasonal Trends in the S&P 500
    - Macroeconoic Factors that contribute to S&P 500 performance
    - Major historical events that affect the S&P 500 (elections, federal reserve meetings, etc)
    - Identify common measures of indexes (volatility, etc)
2. Utilize S&P 500 data from last semester to take measurements and identify the trends found in SMART Goal #1.
    - Be able to idenify (with visualizations like a graph or table) between 5-10 trends or index measurements
    - Show the effects of Macroeconomic factors on S&P 500
3. Complete the Python Cleaning Data course (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python) & put certification on Github
4. Recomplete the ML Track on Datacamp (Supervised & Unsupervised Learning = 2 courses). Take notes in a Jupyter Notebook to prove completion.
5. Identify a list of 5-10 online resources (youtube videos, blog posts, papers, etc) that walk through how people implemented a GAN and/or MLP. Post the list to a markdown file on Github.
