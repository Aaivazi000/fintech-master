Specific
The “specific” section should be absolutely clear and specific. 

Measurable
The “measurable” absolutely must be something that can be shown in the repo
as notebooks written, pages of documentation, python library code you commit,
unit tests you write, or documentation you write. You can tell if this would be
not be acceptable if it is the kind of thing somebody that could hide a lack of
work. For example, if your measurement was merely a short summery of what
you did, that would not be enough. Your measurement must be many lines
of codes, complete orginal notebook with experimental results, many pages of
documentaion (not copied from elsewere) and similar things. You will also write
a summary of it, but that is, by itself, not evidence of having done work. Even if
you honestly did work hard you must produce evidence because I simply cannot
take your word.

Actionable
In the actionable/attainable part, you should justify why you can do it. If you
need a data set you should state where you will get it. If you are going to use
an algorithm you must specify which library and which algorithm. You should
have a plan if something fails. You must explain enough so that it is clear to
you and me that the risk of failure is relatively low.

Relavant
The Relevant part must tie your project back to the proposal and your proposal
goals. This is critical, I will be evaluating if you have created tasks that move
you closer to finishing your project at a reasonable pace or having created busy
work that is just buying some time. 

Timebound
The time will usually be just due next week.

SMART Goal #1
  This week I will be researching more about the structure of GAN and how the parameter works.
I will be playing with our current S&P 500 market data and experiment with the GAN (may or may
not have results). Because GAN is known for inputting and outputting images, I believe I can
input images of the market and expect some image like the market (this will just be a test).
This is relavant to our goal because we need to be able to understand how GAN works while we are
almost working on our framework. This will be done by next week.

SMART Goal #2
  I will implement a bot with a strategy. The bot will be used to test our market at the end.
This is to be done so we know how to create it later on our project. This is relavant to make sure our
market is actually functioning. This will be done by next week.

SMART Goal #3
  I will also be researching more about fundamental analysis. I will be using the S&P 500 to help do my analysis.
This will be used to find patterns to be used into the GAN. This will help us achieve a part of our goal. This will
be done by next week.

SMART Goal #4
