SMART Goal #2
  I will implement a bot with a strategy. The bot will be used to test our market at the end.
This is to be done so we know how to create it later on our project. This is relavant to make sure our
market is actually functioning. This will be done by next week.

SMART Goal #3
  I will also be researching more about fundamental analysis. I will be using the S&P 500 to help do my analysis.
This will be used to find patterns to be used into the GAN. This will help us achieve a part of our goal. This will
be done by next week.

SMART Goal #4
  I will simulate a random walk graph that will mimic how a stock market will look like. This is a model that will
be for testing and slowly built upon.
  
# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Eddie Chen
**Date:** 09/04/2018

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. We don't know much about the GAN despite it's properties. It is essential to learn about this otherwise we will not be able to proceed. We need to also understand it's limitations and capabilties of what it can and can't do. This leads to my first goal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
This week I will be researching more about the structure of GAN and how the parameter works. This will help my team on how we will use the GAN and what we will need to prepare to use in the GAN.

#### M. Measurable: 
I will be playing with our current S&P 500 market data and experiment with the GAN (may or may not have results).

#### A. Achievable: 
Unfortunutely I do not know how GAN takes input and outputs data, which is why I will need to do more research on how GAN works.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relavant to our goal because we need to be able to understand how GAN works while we are working on our framework.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week by 09/11/2018.

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
Fill in

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
Fill in (this should be crisp like implment a specific function, produce a notebook with certain graphs, etc. If it is not something
obvious to me how I would grade success, partial sucess and failure, then you lose points.)

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
Fill in

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
Fill in


#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
Fill in (next week)

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

List the smart goals you completed last week. First list the goal, and then list the locations of the commits or urls of the artificats promised in the smart goal that stand as evidence that what was goal was completed. If there is no such artificat (even if none was promised. This is a zero.)

Last week there were no SMART Goals.
