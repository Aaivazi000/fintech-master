SMART Goal #1
  This week I will be researching more about the structure of GAN and how the parameter works.
I will be playing with our current S&P 500 market data and experiment with the GAN (may or may
not have results). Because GAN is known for inputting and outputting images, I believe I can
input images of the market and expect some image like the market (this will just be a test).
This is relavant to our goal because we need to be able to understand how GAN works while we are
almost working on our framework. This will be done by next week.

SMART Goal #2
  I will implement a bot with a strategy. The bot will be used to test our market at the end.
This is to be done so we know how to create it later on our project. This is relavant to make sure our
market is actually functioning. This will be done by next week.

SMART Goal #3
  I will also be researching more about fundamental analysis. I will be using the S&P 500 to help do my analysis.
This will be used to find patterns to be used into the GAN. This will help us achieve a part of our goal. This will
be done by next week.

SMART Goal #4
  I will simulate a random walk graph that will mimic how a stock market will look like. This is a model that will
be for testing and slowly built upon.

Smart Goal #5
