# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. We don't know much about the GAN despite it's properties. It is essential to learn about this otherwise we will not be able to proceed. We need to also understand it's limitations and capabilties of what it can and can't do. This leads to my first goal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
This week I will be researching more about the structure of GAN and how the parameter works. This will help my team on how we will use the GAN and what we will need to prepare to use in the GAN.

#### M. Measurable: 
I will be playing with our current S&P 500 market data and experiment with the GAN (may or may not have results). There will be detailed explanations on how GAN will function.

#### A. Achievable: 
Unfortunutely I do not know how GAN takes input and outputs data, which is why I will need to do more research on how GAN works.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relavant to our goal because we need to be able to understand how GAN works while we are working on our framework.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week by 09/11/2018.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I will be researching more about fundamental analysis to find more strategies and patterns.

#### M. Measurable: 
obvious to me how I would grade success, partial sucess and failure, then you lose points.)
There will be detailed explanantions on different type of strategies and patterns.

#### A. Achievable: 
As of right now, we do not have knowledge of how much strategies and patterns fundamental analysis will hold. Therefore researching more about this will lead to more future SMART Goals that needs to be done.

#### R. Relevant :
This will be used to help us develop more data into our GAN

#### T. Time-bound: 
It will be completed by next week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
I will be implementing a bot that will utilize the shorting strategy.

#### M. Measurable: 
After creating my simulated model of a stock, this bot shall see if it can detect any patterns to apply shorting to it (though it will be difficult due to it's randomness for the simulation). If not the simulation, I will use one of the S&P 500 stocks or index to see if it can be detected.

#### A. Achievable: 
This is achievable in the given time frame because this is a known strategy that is used in the market.

#### R. Relevant :
In the far future, we will be utilizing these bots to test our simulated market, it is best to learn how it is implemented because this will also help us develop our understanding of the strategies that will be used for our GAN.

#### T. Time-bound: 
This will be completed next week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 4.

#### S. Specific: 
I will be simulating a random walk market, this will be used as modeling, possibily for testing models.

#### M. Measurable: 
In result of this simulation, I shall be able to get an image similar to what we have in a stock (but it isn't our actual simulation).

#### A. Achievable: 
This is achievable because we have learned how to implement this before and have the skillset to create such simulation.

#### R. Relevant :
This is to get an idea of how our simulation may look like and how we can add-on features to it in the future.

#### T. Time-bound: 
This will be completed next week.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

List the smart goals you completed last week. First list the goal, and then list the locations of the commits or urls of the artificats promised in the smart goal that stand as evidence that what was goal was completed. If there is no such artificat (even if none was promised. This is a zero.)

There were no SMART Goals last week.
