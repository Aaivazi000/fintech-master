# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Fully implementing a simple GAN used for testing would be a great achievement for learning and understanding. This is top priortiy.

2. RNN is a great NN to be used for our GAN because it involves time series (which a lot of our data sets rely on). This will be a very interesting research that will greatly help us with our future modeling.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
During last week's SMART Goal, I wasn't able to fully implement the testing GAN. This week I will finish implementing and understand how to structure and tweak the models.

#### M. Measurable: 
This GAN will be fed with the random walk model I created last week. I believe I will be able generate a graph similar to my random walk model.

#### A. Achievable: 
This is achievable within the given time frame as I just need to adjust and tweak parameters (possibly the structure as well) for a working GAN.

#### R. Relevant :
This will greatly help us understand and learn more about how GAN is implemented. This can also result in possible future implementations of other models for the GAN.

#### T. Time-bound: 
This will be done next week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I will need to research on RNN as this NN takes time series as an input, which is perfect for our data.

#### M. Measurable: 
There will be detailed explanations on how we will feed input data, how the modeling is structured, and what is the expecting output.

#### A. Achievable: 
This information is obtainable through proper research, in the future I may also implement a GAN using RNN as a testing feature as well.

#### R. Relevant :
Time series as input has been a problematic though for us, as RNN is introduced to us, we feel like this will help us achieve our goal.

#### T. Time-bound: 
This will be done by next week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
Fill in

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
Fill in (this should be crisp like implment a specific function, produce a notebook with certain graphs, etc. If it is not something
obvious to me how I would grade success, partial sucess and failure, then you lose points.)

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
Fill in

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
Fill in

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
Fill in (next week)

### (you can add 2 more smart goals ... advisable)

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

List the smart goals you completed last week. First list the goal, and then list the locations of the commits or urls of the artificats promised in the smart goal that stand as evidence that what was goal was completed. If there is no such artificat (even if none was promised. This is a zero.)

1) SMART Goal #1, work still in progress, will progress onto week 2
2) SMART Goal #2, completed with breakdown, will need deeper analysis
3) SMART Goal #3, did not do
4) SMART Goal #4, simulation was completed with a graphical representation
