SMART Goals:

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Research how each metric works - what are the properties of the stock that each metric considers and determine how to measure the properties. This should be done as soon as possible. This goal is important because it is crucial to identify early just how and what we'll be evaluating our strategies on. 

#### M. Measurable: 
There will be a doc folder, and also additions to the wiki outlining the different metrics researched this week - such as their definitions and how to calculate the metrics given stock data properties. We will be using the metrics in our project later on for evaluating strategies going forward. 

#### A. Achievable: 
This goal will just require research. The motivation of this goal will be to lay out how we will be evaluating strategies. 

#### R. Relevant:
Is it important to determine the way we will be evaluating strategies early on 

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
Implement the metrics in Python using the dataset we have for now - the S&P 500 data. The code will be written by this week. This is a goal because we want to make sure we have our formulas down for each metric so we know what properties of the data we need to look at in order to calculate each metric. 

#### M. Measurable: 
There will be an IPYNB for each metric implementation. 

#### A. Achievable: 
This will be acheivable because the metrics themselves are only a mathematical analysis in essence, therefore can be done without any extra libraries. We already have our dataset which includes all the properites we'd need to implement each metric. 

#### R. Relevant: 
This goal is  relevant because we want to lay the groundwork for the evaluation. If we have the code  for it now, we can refer back to it for when we have our real dataset and when we want to start evaluating on that data. 

### T. Time-bound: 
Next week 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3. 


3) Implement a function to measure annualized return and annualized volitility since we will be using these two metrics 
to compare strategies. There will be code demonstrating this by next week on our placeholder S&P 500 dataset.
