### S. Specific: 

1) Research how each metric works - i.e., what are the properties of the stock that each metric considers and,
if they are measurable properties, figure out how can we extract these properties from the data? Specificaly, for our data, for now until we 
get our actual dataset, we will use the S&P 500 data to just determine how properties like volitility and mean return 
can be determined for each stock. The result of this goal will be to find out the formulas associated with these properties 
and document them so that we will know exactly what to look for, and how to look for it when we want to compute metrics on our real dataset. 

2) Research how each metric will be used to compare strategies. 

3) Implement a function to measure annualized return and annualized volitility since we will be using these two metrics 
to compare strategies. There will be code demonstrating this by next week on our placeholder S&P 500 dataset.
