SMART Goals:

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 

Research how each metric works - what are the properties of the stock that each metric considers and determine how to measure the properties. This should be done as soon as possible. This goal is important because it is crucial to identify early just how and what we'll be evaluating our strategies on. 

#### M. Measurable: 

There will be a doc folder, and also additions to the wiki outlining the different metrics researched this week - such as their definitions and how to calculate the metrics given stock data properties. We will be using the metrics in our project later on for evaluating strategies going forward. 

#### A. Achievable: 

This goal will just require research. The motivation of this goal will be to lay out how we will be evaluating strategies. 

#### R. Relevant:

Is it important to determine the way we will be evaluating strategies early on 

#### T. Time-bound: 

Next week. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

- Implement metrics in Python code using S&P data. 

3) Implement a function to measure annualized return and annualized volitility since we will be using these two metrics 
to compare strategies. There will be code demonstrating this by next week on our placeholder S&P 500 dataset.
